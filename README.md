This is my project for ASP.NET Core - february 2022 in SoftUni. The project is simple game store, working only with digital sales, similar to other online game and app stores (Steam, Epic Games, Playstation Store, etc.). Their is DataManager role seeded and basic users that can browse the store.The data manager uses the store layout but has its own area and controllers. Insait he can see and enter only action from his controllers and has to use the url if he wants to enter the other site views. The app is using Microsoft SQL Server as db and Games and Genres as its mai entities. It also has extendet User with aded components ,Countries for the users and relational tables for many-to-many relashionships, GameGenres (for Games and Genres), Wishlists (for Games and Users) and OwnedGames (for Games and Users). The DataManager main responsibility is the ability to add, edit and delete games. There is data validation for add and edit. He can also see all games in All action and can search them by name. logged and unlogged User can browse the store and see, search and sort all the games. They can vie the details (developers, release date, etc..). Logged in users can buy or wishlist games they, want to buy later. They can add or remove games from the wishlist if they deside not to buy. They can view and sort their own collection of bought games and can download them from the Details.
